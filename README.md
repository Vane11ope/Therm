Therm
=====

Therm is a fork of iTerm2 that aims to:

* Support old Macs (PPC and x86-32 are still alive)
* Better defaults for power-users (no tabs, dark theme, follow mouse, ...)
* Remove clutchy stuff like maximized indicators, scrollbars or tabs
* No timestamps (removed buggy feature and get some speed)
* No Lion-style fullscreen, standard one is faster and handier
* Fixes application switch issue when follow mouse is enabled
* Non-fullscreen windows have a thin border

This fork has been done by pancake <pancake@nopcode.org>

Future
------

I will continue removing features and options in order to get a small,
fast and nice terminal, so I don't have to change over 9000 settings
to get it working as I expect on first run.

This is the app where I spent more time in my daily workflow, so it make
sense to not over-engineer or make it fully configurable with features
that <10% of users use.


Contributions
-------------

I plan to contribute with iTerm2 by sending bugfixes and feature enhancements
as pullrequests to the original repo, iTerm2 is a great project, and there's
no aim in harming it.
